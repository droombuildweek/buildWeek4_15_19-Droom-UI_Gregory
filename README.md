# buildWeek4_15_19-Droom-UI_Gregory
This website is the FrontEnd of the Droom job matching app.
    It allows a potential job seeker to sign up to the job app.
    This page is the introduction page to our job app.
    Our app is accessible on a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone.
    The technologies used on this multi-page site are Materialize CSS, basic Html, Css and Javascript
    My goal in creating this site is for it to be used as a gateway to our job board app and to complete my build week project with my team.
    This project is completed.
    I have not had any known issues with this page as of yet
